# Power BI Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project is implemented using **Power BI** to analyze sales data. The goal is to provide insights into sales trends, revenue, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to support data-driven decision-making.

## Data Source
- The dataset used for this project is provided in an Excel file (`Power BI - Sales Project Data - Un-cleaned.xlsx`).
- The data includes sales transactions, customer details, product information, and other relevant metrics.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies.
   - Standardized data formats.
   - Created calculated columns and measures using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**.

2. **Data Modeling**
   - Established relationships between tables.
   - Optimized the data model for efficient querying.

3. **Report & Dashboard Development**
   - Designed interactive **Power BI dashboards** with visualizations such as:
     - Sales Trends Over Time
     - Revenue Breakdown by Product & Region
     - Top Performing Customers
     - KPIs like Total Sales, Profit Margins, and Growth Rate
   - Implemented slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration.

4. **Insights & Business Impact**
   - Identified best-selling products and underperforming segments.
   - Provided data-driven recommendations to improve sales strategy.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI Online** for report creation and sharing.
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning and transformation
- **DAX** for advanced calculations.
- **Excel** for data preprocessing.

## How to View This Project
1. To view the interactive dashboards, open the .pbix file using Microsoft Power BI Desktop
2. For a static view of the project and methodology, refer to the PDF documentation
